                but its insane! i never thought i had the ability to even love someone
                <br>
                at this point and then this fag just walks up!
                <br>
                ik its only been 2 weeks but its been great!
                <br>

                this is a sort of letter to you too,
                <br>

                im utterly clueless on how this'll go,
                <br>
                ive had thoughts on how things'll be in the future
                <br>
                whether being girlfriends with you is a casual thing or if things started getting serious
                <br>
                but im just being hopeful at that point, at this point im just really happy of what we have right now
                <br>
                and just maybe, because this is my first "real" experience at loving someone
                <br>
                that it lasts as long as possible

                our talks about how we should approach this thing, how funnily enough we are both
                <br>
                "down for anything", its been really funny to me but it just opens up
                <br> 
                such an unfamiliar area for me, thoughts like "is it okay to do that weve only been tgt for 2 weeks"
                <br>
                keeps myself restrained in what i should do for us.
                <br>
                i must be thinking about it too hard huh? maybe im also overestimating how serious this whole thing is 
                <br>
                but i hope this reads for you about how desperately i dont want to fuck this up
                <br>
                and how i do love you and would hate to break this thing we've got going on

                enough of me being all serious tho! the past 2 weeks have been fun, really fun
                <br>
                i hope its been the same for you too bun! and one more thing i hope for is more nice memories to come!
                <br>
                i love you, if that wasn't clear enough. i really really love you, and i hope we last a long time together.
